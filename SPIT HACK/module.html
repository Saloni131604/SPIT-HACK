        <p>C is a high-level programming language developed in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring performance and efficiency.</p>
        <p>The main features of C include simplicity, efficiency, portability, and flexibility.</p>
        <p>Key concepts include syntax, functions, variables, and data types.</p>
        <p>C uses a structured programming approach that enhances code reusability.</p>
        <p>It is often considered the foundation of modern programming languages.</p>
        <p>The compilation process in C converts code into machine language for execution.</p>
        <p>Understanding basic syntax like main(), printf(), and scanf() is crucial.</p>
        <p>Memory management in C allows dynamic allocation for optimized performance.</p>
        <p>Real-world applications of C include operating systems, database systems, and embedded software.</p>
        <p>Learning C helps develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
